### Data Flow Architecture

The system operates through a sequential process of data acquisition, analysis, and visualization:

1. **Data Acquisition Phase**: Traffic cameras capture continuous video feeds of roadway conditions
2. **Artificial Intelligence Processing**: The computer vision subsystem analyzes the visual data to identify and classify vehicles
3. **Quantitative Analysis**: The system performs algorithmic determination of traffic density and potential anomalies
4. **Data Visualization**: The analytics dashboard presents the processed information in a comprehensible format
5. **Alert System Activation**: The system generates notifications when predefined traffic thresholds are exceeded
6. **Route Optimization**: Alternative routing suggestions are computed based on current traffic distribution
